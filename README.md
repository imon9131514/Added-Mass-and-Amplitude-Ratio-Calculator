# Added-Added Mass Coefficient and Amplitude Ratio CalculatorThis Python script provides a command-line tool to calculate the Added Mass Coefficient (C) and the Amplitude Ratio (A) based on a set of hydrodynamic parameters.The script uses pre-defined empirical formulas, which are functions of a parameter x, for a grid of Bn and B/T values. For inputs that fall between the grid points, it uses 2D linear interpolation to estimate the results.FeaturesInteractive CLI: Easy-to-use command-line interface that prompts the user for inputs.Interpolation: Utilizes scipy to perform 2D linear interpolation for Bn and B/T values that are not explicitly defined in the equations.Continuous Calculation: Runs in a loop to allow for multiple calculations without restarting the script.Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for non-numeric inputs and a clean exit mechanism.RequirementsTo run this script, you need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:NumPy: For numerical operations.SciPy: For the interpolation functionality.You can install these dependencies using pip:pip install numpy scipy
How to UseSave the Script: Save the code as a Python file (e.g., hydro_calculator.py).Run from Terminal: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the script with the following command:python hydro_calculator.py
Enter Inputs: The script will prompt you to enter the following values one by one:BnB/TxView Results: After you provide the inputs, the script will print the calculated Added Mass Coefficient (C) and Amplitude Ratio (A).Exit the Program: The script will continue to ask for new inputs. To stop the program, simply type exit at any prompt and press Enter, or press Ctrl+C.Example SessionContinuous C and A Value Calculator
Press Ctrl+C or type 'exit' at any prompt to quit.

Enter the value for Bn (or type 'exit' to quit): 0.75
Enter the value for B/T (or type 'exit' to quit): 1.0
Enter the value for x (or type 'exit' to quit): 0.5
For Bn: 0.75, B/T: 1.0, x: 0.5 --> Added Mass Coefficient (C): 1.1685875
For Bn: 0.75, B/T: 1.0, x: 0.5 --> Amplitude Ratio (A): 0.9025

Enter the value for Bn (or type 'exit' to quit): exit
Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!
How It WorksThe core of the script consists of two dictionaries, equations_c and equations_a. These dictionaries map specific Bn and B/T values to lambda functions. These functions, which are polynomials of x, define the relationship for C and A at discrete, tabulated points.When a user provides inputs for Bn, B/T, and x, the script does the following:It evaluates all the stored polynomial equations using the user's x value to create a grid of C and A results.It then uses scipy.interpolate.RegularGridInterpolator to perform a 2D linear interpolation over this grid.This interpolation finds the estimated C and A values corresponding to the user's specific Bn and B/T inputs.If the provided Bn or B/T values are outside the range of the defined data, the interpolator will return NaN (Not a Number), and the script will inform the user that the value is out of bounds.-and-Amplitude-Ratio-Calculator
